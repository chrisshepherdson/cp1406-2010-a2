<h2>The HTML 5</h2>

<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
<p>The purpose of this website is to promote the events and existence of the Townsville Community Music Centre in order to: increase and engage the membership of the TMCM; increase ticket sales; and finally, to encourage the participation and involvement of artists.</p>
    
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>The success of this website will be evaluated by:</p>
    <ui>
        <li>Measuring the increase of new members.</li>
        <li>Measuring the increase of members volunteering to help with events or administration.</li>
        <li>Measuring the increase of ticket sales for TCMC hosted events.</li>

        <li>Assessing the feedback from the public, members and artists.</li>
    </ui>
    
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>The target audience for the TCMC is people with a musical/creative background, but also with a diverse taste in musical genres. This audience will be targeted through the use of a dark colour scheme that is neutral and also makes the content much more prominent. The artists and event information will also be within separate containers allowing for their content to be put into different themes. Different themes means that the artists can appeal to their specific part of the diverse audience that is being targeted.</p>
