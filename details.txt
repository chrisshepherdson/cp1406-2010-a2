Goals for the Music Centre website (as stated by the client):

Membership 
- recruit new members
- increase engagement of members in our activities, e.g. volunteering for administration, organising and promoting concerts and workshops

Concerts 
- increase ticket sales, especially to the general public. 
- encourage performers to let us organise a concert for them
- encourage performers to cooperate with promotion, photo shoots, media releases, etc.

Target audience:
- we "specialise in diversity" i.e. we provide performance opportunities for a very wide range of styles and genres which would otherwise have little exposure, therefore our target audience includes a wide range of ages and tastes. The typical audience may include people with specialised tastes, e.g. classical, jazz, ethnic music, etc. If children are involved, then parents and family members predominate. Every concert, therefore, needs a distinctive theme.

Townsville has a population of about 200,000 and is growing at about 1 suburb per year, so there is a lot of musical activity. All private schools and most government schools have music teachers.
